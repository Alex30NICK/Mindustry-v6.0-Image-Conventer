# Mindustry-v6.0-Image-to-Screen-Conventer
Ok, Hi I create a simple image convertor for Logic Screens and Processors from mindustry v6.0.

HOW TO USE?

First of all you should convert you following image to 80x80 px or split it to tiles 80x80 px, because LScreen resolution is 80x80 only.

Second step is to import you rescaled image to script.

Third step enjoy your Processors instruction list to draw image.
